\f0\fs24 \cf0 # LoremIpsum Publishing House - Brand & Book Page Strategy  \
*A New Era of Author-Centric Publishing*  \
\
---\
\
## \uc0\u55357 \u56960  **Business Overview**  \
### Core Philosophy  \
**We\'92re rewriting the rules of publishing.**  \
LoremIpsum exists to dismantle the traditional gatekeeping of the publishing industry. Our model is built on radical transparency, author empowerment, and community-driven storytelling. We\'92re not just a publisher\'97we\'92re a movement.  \
\
### Why We\'92re Different  \
- **50% Revenue Sharing**: Authors keep half of every sale, far above the industry standard (typically 10\'9625%).  \
- **Zero Upfront Costs**: No hidden fees, no \'93vanity publishing\'94 traps. We invest in you because we believe in your work.  \
- **Direct-to-Reader Sales**: Authors get a customizable, branded book page to sell directly to their audience, cutting out middlemen.  \
- **Launch Support**: We host virtual and in-person book launches, handling logistics so authors can focus on celebrating their work.  \
\
### Proof of Concept  \
- **3 Published Titles**: Including *"The Unseen Chapter"* (literary fiction) and *"Code & Canvas"* (non-fiction).  \
- **100+ Copies Sold at Launch**: Our most recent title sold out its first print run during its debut event.  \
- **Author Retention**: 100% of our authors return for second projects.  \
